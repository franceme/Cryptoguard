* Please visit the Notebook link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/franceme/cryptoguard/2020_SecDev_Tutorial?filepath=SecDev_Tutorial.ipynb) to try running through our sample demo.

## [MyBinder](https://mybinder.org/)
This is a website hosting a Docker image that actively runs either Java or Python3 samples. The Java Notebook is only possible by utilitzing [IJava](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava). This is still under progress.

### IMPORTANT NOTICE

* Due to an internal library issue, the tests here may be "leaky".
These have been fixed throughout the JUnit tests and hopefully within the Notebook by using [quarantining-test-runner](https://github.com/BinaryTweed/quarantining-test-runner).

### Help

* If you have any questions or suggestions, please email to <sazzad114@gmail.com> or <frantzme@vt.edu>.
